# pyAnalysisOnStockAndGoldPrice

The objective of this research paper is to examine the relationship between the gold price and the Shanghai Composite Index (SSE). 

## Data
The study used the daily adjusted data for the past 10 years from January 2009 to December 2018. 

## Programming Tools
The tools that used in this project are Python, numpy, pandas, statsmodels, matlpotlib. Based on these tools, the following steps applied in this project: data cleaning, data visualization, time-series regression modelling and predictive analysis.

## Statistical Techniques
To achieve the aims of the study, several statistical techniques are used such as Unit Root Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, Johnson Co-integration Test and Vector Autoregression Model (VAR). Lagrange Multiplier Test and Stability Test will also be imposed to test the accuracy of the model.  

## Result
The result shows that there is no long-term relationship between the stock index and the gold price and there is no short-term relationship between the two variables either.
